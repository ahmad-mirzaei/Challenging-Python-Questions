## `General description` :
<p>We want to solve challenging Python questions together. 
Maybe on the way to the challenge, the answer to some questions requires searching on the internet. 
which makes progress and learning. So hello to Python...</p>

b = 1 // 2

# a) Both a and b are equal to 0.
# b) a is equal to 0.5, and b is equal to 0.
# c) a is equal to 0, and b is equal to 0.5.
# d) Both a and b are equal to 1.

x = 10
y = 3
z = x ** 2 + y * 5 - x // y

# a) 105
# b) 112
# c) 106
# d) 110
```
---
## `String` :
***`11.`*** Write a program that extracts the fifth character from the given string.
```python
text = "Python programming"
```
***`12.`*** Write a program that prints the following string in reverse order.
```python
text = "programming"
```
***`13.`*** Write a program that checks for the presence of lang in the following string.
```python
text = "python programming language"
```
***`14.`*** Write a program that separates the given string based on commas.
```python
text = "python,php,javascript,django,laravel,react"
```
***`15.`*** In the string below, **replace** the word `Python` with the word `nothing`.
```python
text = "I love nothing"
```
***`16.`*** Convert the words in the list below into a string. You can use the default `" ".join()` function.
```python
words = ["Python", "is", "very", "lovely"]
```
***`17.`*** Write a program that converts the following string to uppercase.
```python
text = "challenging python questions together"
```
***`18.`*** Write a program that determines the number of times the word `banana` occurs.
```python
text = "banana applebanana apple apple banana apple banana bananaapple"
```
***`19.`*** Use this function to find the `ASCII` code of the character `'P'`.
```python
ord()
```
***`20.`***  Use this function to find the character corresponding to the `ASCII` code `89`.
```python
chr()
```
***`21.`*** How can you combine the values of different variables into a single string using **f-strings** in Python? For example, display your name and age in a sentence. Assume your name is `"ÙŽAhmad"` and your age is 36.
```python
name = "Ahmad"
age = 36
```
***`22.`*** How can you format a large number to display with commas separating every three digits using `f-strings` in Python? For example, format the number `1234567890`to display as `1,234,567,890` .
```python
number = 1234567890
```

## `List` : 

***`23.`*** Show how to access the first and last elements of the list.
```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
***`24.`*** Get the length of the following lists using the `len()` function.
```python
num_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
str_list_1 = ["python programming language is the best"]
str_list_2 = ["python", "programming", "language", "is", "the best"]
```
***`25.`*** <br />
a) How can you access the second element of the first list `(the number 2)`?<br />
b) How can you access the first element of the second list `(the string "apple")`?<br />
c) How can you access the last element of the third list `(the value False)`?
```python
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], ["python", "django", "django rest"], [True, False]]
```
***`26.`*** Use the `append()` function to add the number `8` to this list. Print the result.
```python
numbers = [2, 4, 6]
```
***`27.`*** Use the `append()` function to add the name `"Ahmad"` to the end of this list. Then, print the final list.
```python
names = ["Ali", "Sara", "Reza"]
```
***`28.`*** Use the `remove()` function to remove the number `3` from this list. Print the final list.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
***`29.`*** Write a program that removes the last number from list a using `pop()` function and adds it to list b using `append()` function.
```python
a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
b = []
```
***`30.`*** Insert the letter c into the second index of the list using the `insert()` function.
```python
words = ['a', 'b', 'd']
```
***`31.`***
- Use the `insert()` function to insert the number `20` in the appropriate place in the list;
- Then enter the number `30` at the end of the list using `insert()` and `len()`;
- Then add the next number with the `append()` function.
```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 25]
```
***`32.`*** Combine the following two lists and then display them in the output.
```python
a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
***`33.`*** Combine the following `3` lists and then get the sum of the final list with the `sum()` function.
```python
a = [0, 1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
c = [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
```

## `Dictionary` :

***`34.`*** Combine dictionary 1 and 2 together.
